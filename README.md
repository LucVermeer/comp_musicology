# comp_musicology

My corpus will consist of the Spotify Playlist "Track een bak mania".

This is a playlist that is meant to be played when playing the drinking game Track een back mania. It involves the classic game Track Mania.
Because of its classic character it consist mostly of nostalgic songs, uptempo songs to recreate the feeling of playing racing games in the 2000s while also providing enough fun for being played while partying. 
In this course I will try to find out what makes for nostalgic songs and why some songs are fit for driving and drifting and some are not. Categories that will probably be of interest include what year the tracks are released in, the BPM of the songs. I will research if there are certain keys that songs fit for racing are played in.
